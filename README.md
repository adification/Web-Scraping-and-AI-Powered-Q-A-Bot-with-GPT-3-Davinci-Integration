Title : Web Scraping and AI-Powered Q&A Bot with GPT-3 Integration for Text Extraction and Analysis

#1.Imports necessary libraries, including BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing, requests for making HTTP requests, and OpenAI for GPT-3 integration.
#2.Sets up OpenAI API credentials.
#3.Defines a function to extract plain text from HTML content.
#4.Prompts the user to input a URL to scrape.
#5.Utilizes an external web scraping API (ScrapingDog) to retrieve the HTML content from the provided URL.
#6.Parses the HTML content to extract plain text and cleans it up.
#7.Uses GPT-3 (Davinci) to generate background information based on the extracted plain text.
#8.Initiates a Q&A interaction loop where the user can input questions, and the script uses GPT-3 to provide answers based on the extracted text and generated background.
#9.The loop continues until the user enters 'exit'.

Overall, this code combines web scraping and AI-driven Q&A using GPT-3 to extract insights from online content and answer user questions.
